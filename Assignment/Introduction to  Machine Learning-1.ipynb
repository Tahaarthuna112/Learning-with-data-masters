    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a virtual personal assistant like Siri or Google Assistant. These AI systems use natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries. They can perform tasks such as setting reminders, answering questions, or providing recommendations, showcasing a level of intelligence in understanding and responding to human input.\n",

    "b) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for a task, a machine learning model can learn and improve its performance through experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to build a spam email filter. In traditional programming, you might manually write rules to identify spam. In machine learning, you would feed the algorithm a large dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam). The algorithm learns patterns from this data, and when presented with new, unseen emails, it can predict whether they are spam or not based on what it has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks are capable of learning and representing intricate patterns in data, making them particularly powerful for tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a deep learning application for image recognition. A deep neural network can be trained on a dataset of images to recognize objects. As the network goes through layers, it learns hierarchical features, such as edges, textures, and shapes. Once trained, the network can accurately identify objects in new images, even those it has never seen before, showcasing the depth of learning achieved through the layers.\n",
