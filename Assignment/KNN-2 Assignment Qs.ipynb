    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric lies in how they measure distance between data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences in each dimension.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the Euclidean distance between two points \\( P(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( Q(x_2, y_2) \\) in a 2-dimensional space is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{Euclidean Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance considers the overall spatial relationship between data points and is sensitive to differences in all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Manhattan Distance:\n",
    "   - Manhattan distance, also known as city block distance or L1 distance, is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the Manhattan distance between two points \\( P(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( Q(x_2, y_2) \\) in a 2-dimensional space is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{Manhattan Distance} = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1| \\]\n",
    "   - Manhattan distance measures the distance a person would walk along a grid-like street network to reach from one point to another and is not affected by diagonal movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on KNN Classifier or Regressor Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sensitivity to Feature Scales: Euclidean distance considers the overall spatial relationship between data points, including differences in all dimensions. Therefore, it may be sensitive to differences in feature scales. If features have significantly different scales, those with larger scales can dominate the distance calculations, leading to biased results. On the other hand, Manhattan distance measures the absolute differences in each dimension independently and is less affected by differences in feature scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Outliers: Euclidean distance squares the differences in each dimension, making it more sensitive to outliers compared to Manhattan distance, which only considers the absolute differences. Therefore, Manhattan distance may be more robust to outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Relationships: The choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance can affect how the algorithm captures relationships between features. Euclidean distance considers the overall spatial relationship, which may be more suitable for capturing nonlinear relationships between features. In contrast, Manhattan distance measures distance along grid-like paths, which may be more appropriate for datasets where relationships between features are linear or piecewise linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance in KNN can affect the algorithm's performance, particularly in terms of sensitivity to feature scales, handling of outliers, and capturing feature relationships. Experimentation and validation techniques are essential for determining the most suitable distance metric based on the characteristics of the dataset and the specific requirements of the problem at hand."
