    "\n",
    "Here's how a pair confusion matrix differs from a regular confusion matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification focus: A regular confusion matrix typically summarizes the performance of a classification model across all classes in the dataset. In contrast, a pair confusion matrix focuses specifically on evaluating the performance of a binary classification model for two specific classes of interest.\n",

However, in the case of a pair confusion matrix, these metrics are calculated specifically for the two classes of interest, providing a more targeted assessment of the model's performance for those classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair confusion matrices can be particularly useful in certain situations, including:\n",

A score close to 0 suggests overlapping clusters, while negative scores indicate that objects may have been assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",

In such cases, a classifier can achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class most of the time, while performing poorly on minority classes.\n",

It doesn't distinguish between false positives and false negatives, which may have different consequences depending on the application. For instance, in medical diagnosis, a false negative (missing a positive case) may be more critical than a false positive (incorrectly identifying a negative case).\n",

    "4. Sensitive to class distribution changes: Accuracy can be sensitive to changes in the class distribution. Even if a classifier maintains the same level of performance, changes in the class distribution can lead to fluctuations in accuracy.\n",

    "To address these limitations, alternative evaluation metrics and techniques can be used:\n",
    "\n",

Precision and Recall: Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by the classifier. Precision and recall provide insights into the classifier's performance on positive instances and help address the issue of class imbalance.\n",
